## <a id="introduction"></a>Introduction

**Update February 2025**: The Data Platform Libraries and this project are outdated. There is a new and improve [LSEG Data Library for Python](https://developers.lseg.com/en/api-catalog/lseg-data-platform/lseg-data-library-for-python) (aka Data Library version 2) available now. Please see the updated project with the strategic LSEG Data Library on [Example.DataLibrary.Python.RequestsComparison](https://github.com/LSEG-API-Samples/Example.DataLibrary.Python.RequestsComparison) repository.

The [Delivery Platform (RDP) APIs](https://developers.lseg.com/en/api-catalog/refinitiv-data-platform/refinitiv-data-platform-apis) (formerly known as Refinitiv Data Platform) provide various LSEG data and content for developers via easy to use Web base API. The developers which are data scientist, financial coder or trader can use any programming languages that support HTTP request-response and JSON message to retrieve content from RDP in a straightforward way. An example use case are data scientists or trader use [Python language](https://www.python.org/) with the [requests library](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/) to get data from RDP and visualize that data in [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) application.

The [Data Platform Libraries](https://developers.lseg.com/en/api-catalog/refinitiv-data-platform/refinitiv-data-platform-libraries) are ease-of-use APIs defining a set of uniform interfaces providing the developer access to the RDP. The libraries let developers can get data easier than using RDP APIs with Python and requests library directly. 

This article demonstrates how easy developers can get LSEG content via RDP Libraries by comparing the application source code using RDP Libraries ```PlatformSession ``` versus the code using Python/requests to get the same data. The comparison also can be applied to developers who use other Python HTTP libraries such as [http.client](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/http.client.html#module-http.client) or [urllib.request](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/urllib.request.html#module-urllib.request).

Note: This article is focusing on **the comparison of how to get data** only. The reason is once the application receives data from either direct RDP APIs call or RDP Libraries, the data processing or visualize logic are the same.


## <a id="rdp_libs"></a>What is Data Platform (RDP) Libraries?

**Update January 2025**: This project uses Data Platform Libraries, which is the **beta** version of the Python library. The strategic and improved [LSEG Data Library for Python](https://developers.lseg.com/en/api-catalog/lseg-data-platform/lseg-data-library-for-python) is version 2. Please find more detail on the [Essential Guide to the Data Libraries](https://developers.lseg.com/en/article-catalog/article/essential-guide-to-the-data-libraries) article.

LSEG provides wide range of contents and data which require multiple technologies, delivery mechanisms, data formats and also the multiple APIs to access each content. The RDP Libraries are suite of ease-of-use interfaces providing unified access to streaming and non-streaming data services offered within the Delivery Platform (RDP). The Libraries simplified how to access data to various delivery modes such as Request Response, Streaming, Bulk File and Queues via a single library. 

Depending on the level of service and data requirements, developers can easily choose how to access data services using the appropriate access channel defined within the library.

![Figure-1](images/rdp_libraries_1.png "RDP Libraries Diagram") 

Using the library developers can access content from all 3 of the access points - all from within the same application if required. 


### Disclaimer

As these articles are based on alpha version 1.0.0.a0 of the Python library, the method signatures, data formats etc are subject to change.

## <a id="authen"></a>Initialize and Authentication

RDP APIs entitlement check is based on OAuth 2.0 specification. The first step of an application work flow is to get a token, which will allow access to the protected resource, i.e. data REST API's. The API requires the following access credential information:

- Username: The username. 
- Password: Password associated with the username. .
- Client ID: This is also known as ```AppKey```, and it is generated using an Appkey Generator. This unique identifier is defined for the user or application and is deemed confidential (not shared between users). The client_id parameter can be passed in the request body or as an “Authorization” request header that is encoded as base64.

Both RDP APIs and RDP Libraries PlatformSession applications require the above access credentials to initiate and authentication with the platform.

Please contact your LSEG's representative to help you to access RDP credentials. You can generate/manage the AppKey from [AppKeyGenerator web site](https://amers1-apps.platform.refinitiv.com/apps/AppkeyGenerator) or AppKey Generator tool in Workspace application. Other useful document to help developers get start with RDP account is [Getting Start with Data Platform article](https://developers.lseg.com/en/article-catalog/article/getting-start-with-refinitiv-data-platform).

### Direct RDP APIs call with Python/requests

The application needs to send a HTTP Post message with the access credentials to RDP Auth Service endpoint ```https://api.refinitiv.com:443/auth/oauth2/v1/token``` (as of July 2020, the current version of RDP Auth Service is **v1**). 

A successful authentication response message from RDP Auth Service contains the following parameters:
- **access_token**: The token used to invoke REST data API calls as described above. The application must keep this credential for further RDP/Real-Time - Optimized requests.
- **refresh_token**: Refresh token to be used for obtaining an updated access token before expiration. The application must keep this credential for access token renewal.
- **expires_in**: Access token validity time in seconds.
- **scope**: A list of all the scopes this token can be used with.

For the full detail and explanation of RDP Authentication process application workflow, please refer to the following RDP APIS tutorials:
- [Introduction to the Request-Response API](https://developers.lseg.com/en/api-catalog/refinitiv-data-platform/refinitiv-data-platform-apis/tutorials#introduction-to-the-request-response-api).
- [Authorization - All about tokens](https://developers.lseg.com/en/api-catalog/refinitiv-data-platform/refinitiv-data-platform-apis/tutorials#authorization-all-about-tokens).
- [Authorization in Python](https://developers.lseg.com/en/api-catalog/refinitiv-data-platform/refinitiv-data-platform-apis/tutorials#authorization-in-python).

Example Code with Python request library:

```python
import json
import requests

scope = 'trapi'
client_secret = ''

RDP_version = "/v1"
base_URL = "https://api.refinitiv.com"
category_URL = "/auth/oauth2"
endpoint_URL = "/token"

auth_endpoint = base_URL + category_URL + RDP_version + endpoint_URL

auth_obj = None
response = None

# -- Init and Authenticate Session

auth_request_msg = {
    'username': RDP_LOGIN,
	'password': RDP_PASSWORD,
	'grant_type': "password",
	'scope': scope,
	'takeExclusiveSignOnControl': "true"
}

try:
    response = requests.post(auth_endpoint, headers = {'Accept':'application/json'}, data = auth_request_msg, auth = (APP_KEY,client_secret))
except Exception as exp:
	print('Caught exception: %s' % str(exp))

if response.status_code == 200:  # HTTP Status 'OK'
    print('RDP APIs: Authentication success')
    auth_obj = response.json()
    print('RDP access_token = %s' % auth_obj['access_token'])
    print('RDP refresh_token = %s' % auth_obj['refresh_token'])
    print('RDP expires_in = %d' % int(auth_obj['expires_in']))
else:
    print('RDP APIs: Authentication result failure: %s %s' % (response.status_code, response.reason))
    print('Text: %s' % (response.text))
```

The above code is very straightforward, the application creates an authentication request message in JSON message format, send HTTP Post request message and get authentication result if HTTP status response is 200 (Ok).  

However, the RDP Libraries give developers the easiest way to authenticates with RDP Auth Service.

### RDP Libraries

With RDP Libraries, the first thing the application needs to do is create a **Session** with the following logical connection points based on how the application intend to access the platform. The session is an interface to a specific access channel and is responsible for defining authentication details, managing connection resources, and implementing the necessary protocol to manage the life cycle of the session. The list of supported connection points are following:
- DesktopSession ( Workspace)
- PlatformSession (RDP, Real-Time Optimized)
- DeployedPlatformSession (deployed Real-Time/ADS)

Lets focus on the PlatformSession session which requires the same RDP access credentials as a direct call to RDP APIs.

Example Code:
python
```python
import refinitiv.dataplatform as rdp

# -- Init and Authenticate Session
try:
    session = rdp.open_platform_session(
        APP_KEY, 
        rdp.GrantPassword(
            username = RDP_LOGIN, 
            password = RDP_PASSWORD
        )
    )
    print('Session Status: ', session.get_open_state())
except Exception as exp:
	print('Caught exception: %s' % str(exp))
```

Thats it, the application just pass the same RDP access credentials to the Libraries ```open_platform_session()``` function to initialize session and authenticate with RDP Auth Service. Once the session is established , application can check the session status with the ```get_open_state()``` function.

The RDP Libraries application source code is simple and easy to read when comparing to the Python requests library code above.

## <a id="request_data"></a>Requesting RDP Data

Once the application success authenticates with RDP platform, the application can request data/content from the platform. 

### Direct RDP APIs call with Python/requests

When the application receives the Access Token (an authorization token) from RDP Auth Service, all subsequent REST API calls will use this token to get the data. The application needs to input Access Token via *Authorization* HTTP request message header as shown below. 
- Header: 
    * Authorization = ```Bearer <RDP Access Token>```

Please notice *the space* between the ```Bearer``` and ```RDP Access Token``` values.

The application then creates a request message in a JSON message format or URL query parameter based on interested service and send it as a HTTP request message to the Service Endpoint. Developers can get RDP APIs the Service Endpoint, HTTP operations and parameters from Refinitiv Data Platform's [API Playground page](https://apidocs.refinitiv.com/Apps/ApiDocs) - which an interactive documentation site developers can access once they have a valid Refinitiv Data Platform account.

The first example is requesting data from RDP Historical-Pricing Service. 

Example Code for RDP Historical-Pricing Service:

```python
# Authentication success with Access Token in auth_obj['access_token']

RDP_version = '/v1'
base_URL = 'https://api.refinitiv.com'
category_URL = '/data/historical-pricing'
service_endpoint_URL = '/views/events'

historical_pricing_url = base_URL + category_URL + RDP_version + service_endpoint_URL + '/EUR=' #https://api.refinitiv.com/data/historical-pricing/v1/views/events/EUR=

# Set start date and timestamp to be yesterday in UTC timezoe and in ISO8601 format
start = (datetime.now() + timedelta(-1)).astimezone(tz.gettz('UTC')).replace(tzinfo=None)
start_iso = start.isoformat(timespec='microseconds') + '000Z' #example value 2020-07-13T08:54:53.619177000Z

payload = {'adjustments': 'exchangeCorrection,manualCorrection', 'start': start_iso , 'count':15}

try:
    response = requests.get(historical_pricing_url, headers={'Authorization': 'Bearer {}'.format(auth_obj['access_token'])}, params = payload)
except Exception as exp:
	print('Caught exception: %s' % str(exp))

if response.status_code == 200:  # HTTP Status 'OK'
    print('This is a Historical Pricing data result from RDP API Call')
    print(response.json())
    #print(json.dumps(response.json(),sort_keys=True, indent=2, separators=(',', ':')))
else:
    print('RDP APIs: Pricing data request failure: %s %s' % (response.status_code, response.reason))
    print('Text: %s' % (response.text))
```

The other example is RDP Business Summary Service which returns data for business summary of the specific RIC or permId.

Example Code for Business summary Service:

```python
# Authentication success with RDP Auth Service Access Token in auth_obj['access_token']

# -- Business summary

RDP_version = '/v1'
base_URL = 'https://api.refinitiv.com'
category_URL = '/user-framework/mobile/overview-service'
service_endpoint_URL = '/corp/business-summary'
universe = 'IBM.N'

business_summary_url = base_URL + category_URL + RDP_version + service_endpoint_URL + '/' + universe #https://api.refinitiv.com/user-framework/mobile/overview-service/v1/corp/business-summary/IBM.N

try:
    response = requests.get(business_summary_url, headers={'Authorization': 'Bearer {}'.format(auth_obj['access_token'])})
except Exception as exp:
	print('Caught exception: %s' % str(exp))

if response.status_code == 200:  # HTTP Status 'OK'
    print('This is a Business summary data result from RDP API Call')
    print(response.json())
else:
    print('RDP APIs: Business summary data request failure: %s %s' % (response.status_code, response.reason))
    print('Text: %s' % (response.text))
```

The above code from two Services show that the main application logic is the same even the application change interested service. The application just needs to change the Service Endpoint URL and request message.

### RDP Libraries 

With RDP Libraries, the application does not need to handle the Access Token information. The application just calls the Libraries interfaces to get data after session initialization success, the Libraries will manage the Session and authentication information for the application.

RDP libraries offers 3 abstraction layers for supporting the largest audience of developers possible from Citizen developers to seasoned professionals:
- Function: Highest level - single function call to get data
- Content: High level - Fuller response and Level 1 Streaming data too
- Delivery: For data sets not supported by Function or Content Layer

![Figure-2](images/rdp_libraries_layers.png "RDP Libraries Layers") 

#### RDP Libraries : Function Layer

The RDP Libraries *Function Layer* provides the easiest to the most commonly used data content such as News Headlines and Stories, retrieving historical intraday/interday data etc. The Function layer interfaces are single function call aims for scripting languages like Python which allows researchers, data scientists or the casual developer to rapidly prototype solutions within interactive environments such as [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).

Let see the RDP Libraries code that request the same Historical-Pricing data.

Example Code for RDP Historical-Pricing Service:

```python
# rdp.open_platform_session initialize call success

try:
    response = rdp.get_historical_price_events(
        universe = universe, 
        eventTypes= rdp.EventTypes.TRADE,
        start = yesterday,  # timedelta(-1) : example value 2020-07-13T08:54:53.619177000Z
        count = 15,
        adjustments = [
            rdp.Adjustments.EXCHANGE_CORRECTION,
            rdp.Adjustments.MANUAL_CORRECTION
        ]
    )
except Exception as exp:
	print('Caught exception: %s' % str(exp))

if response is not None:
    print('This is a Pricing result from RDP library')
    print(response)
    print('By default, the RDP library Function Layer always returns data in DataFrame format')
    print(type(response))
```

The Libraries simplify the HTTP request-response operations source code into a single function call with set of helper types and enumerate variables for creating a query parameters. The application does not need to manual set the HTTP header or check the HTTP status. The Function Layer is the easiest way to access RDP content with just a few line of code.

Please note that the Function Layer returns data as Pandas [DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html) data type by default because the Layer aims to run on Jupyter Notebook environment. 

#### RDP Libraries : Content Layer

RDP Libraries *Content Layer* provides full detail response from the platform or using Asynchronous/Event-Driven operating mode application. The Content Layer interfaces are logical market data objects, largely representing financial items like level 1 market data prices and quotes,  Order Books, News, Historical Pricing, Company Research data and so on. 

An example Content Layer interface is ```Historical Pricing``` that represents Time-Series data service. Developers can interact with this interface to get the  Historical Price data the same as Function Layer above but with more detail response. 

Example Code:

```python
# rdp.open_platform_session initialize call success

try:
    response = rdp.HistoricalPricing.get_events(
        universe = universe, 
        eventTypes= rdp.EventTypes.TRADE,
        start = yesterday,  # timedelta(-1) : example value 2020-07-13T08:54:53.619177000Z
        count = 15,
        adjustments = [
            rdp.Adjustments.EXCHANGE_CORRECTION,
            rdp.Adjustments.MANUAL_CORRECTION
        ]
    )
except Exception as exp:
	print('RDP Libraries: Content Layer exception: %s' % str(exp))

if response is not None:
    print('The application can get RDP Libraries Content Layer in JSON format with data.raw property')
    print(response.data.raw)

    print('The application can get RDP Libraries Content Layer in Dataframe format with data.df property')
    print(response.data.df)
```

The Content Layer interface is just a little bit complex than the Function Layer but it is still just one function call. This Layer provides a response data in various type such as the raw data (JSON) and Pandas Dataframe. Developers can choose the best data type that match their requirement without need to manual convert the type in the application level.

The Content Layer also supports more application operation modes such as Asynchronous/Event-Driven and also support the real-time Streaming requests for Level 1 Market Price data. Please see more detail regarding the Content Layer in [Discover our Refinitiv Data Platform Library (part 1) tutorial](https://developers.lseg.com/en/article-catalog/article/discover-our-refinitiv-data-platform-library-part-1).


### RDP Libraries - Delivery Layer

LSEG is developing the library and hope to offer Function and Content Layers support for other data content such as Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) data, Fundamentals and so on. In the meantime, the Libraries also let developers access to a wide range of content that not available in Function and Content Layers yet with the *Delivery Layer*. 

The Delivery Layer supports Request (HTTP Request/Response), Stream (WebSockets), Queue (Alerts) and Files (bulk) delivery modes of the RDP. Developers can use Delivery Layer interfaces to explicitly specify their own resource, so long as that resource is available from the selected access channel. It is the lowest abstraction layer that targets developers who need specific features that are not offered by other higher level abstraction layers (Content & Function Layers).

Developers can get Service Endpoint and Request parameters information of the interested Service from the [API Playground page](https://apidocs.refinitiv.com/Apps/ApiDocs), then use the Delivery Layer interface to request data with a few functions call.


Example Code for Business summary Service:

```python
# rdp.open_platform_session initialize call success

category_URL = '/user-framework/mobile/overview-service'
service_endpoint_URL = '/corp/business-summary'

endpoint_url = base_URL + category_URL + RDP_version + service_endpoint_URL + '/' + universe #https://api.refinitiv.com/user-framework/mobile/overview-service/v1/corp/business-summary/IBM.N
try:
    endpoint = rdp.Endpoint(session, endpoint_url)
    response = endpoint.send_request()
    print('This is a Business summary data result from RDP library')
    print(response.data.raw)
    print('\n')
except Exception as exp:
	print('RDP Libraries: Delivery Layer exception: %s' % str(exp))
```

Even though developers interested in the content/services that not available in Function and Content Layers yet, developers can use the Delivery Layer to request that data from the platform with just a simple functions call without need to manual create a HTTP request message. 

Please see more detail regarding how to use Delivery Layer Layer for various types of delivery modes as HTTP Post request and Streaming Level 2 Data in [Discover our Refinitiv Data Platform Library (part 2) tutorial](https://developers.lseg.com/en/article-catalog/article/discover-our-refinitiv-data-platform-library-part-2).

## <a id="revoke_session"></a>Un-initialize and Revoke Authentication

### Direct RDP APIs call with Python/requests

The application needs to send the revoke request message to RDP Auth Service to revoke authorization of the Access Token.

Example Code:

```python
# -- Close Session, sending revoke access token request 
close_request_msg = {
    'token': auth_obj['access_token']
}

endpoint_URL = "/revoke"

revoke_endpoint = base_URL + category_URL + RDP_version + endpoint_URL

try:
    response = requests.post(revoke_endpoint, headers = {'Accept':'application/json'}, data = close_request_msg, auth = (APP_KEY,client_secret))
except Exception as exp:
	print('Caught exception: %s' % str(exp))

if response.status_code == 200:  # HTTP Status 'OK'
    print('RDP APIs: Revoke access token success')
    print(response)
else:
    print('RDP APIs: Revoke access token failure: %s %s' % (response.status_code, response.reason))
    print('Text: %s' % (response.text))
```

### RDP Libraries

The application just calls RDP Libraries ```close_session()``` function to close the current Session.

Example Code:

```python
# -- Close Session, just calls close_session() function
rdp.close_session()
print(session.get_open_state())
```

## <a id="rdp_benefit"></a>Other benefits of using RDP Libraries

With RDP Libraries, developers are not limited only to the RDP, but developers also can access the Workspace desktop application and Deployed/Managed Real-Time Distribution System (RTDS) infrastructure platforms with the same set of API. Using the library you can access content from all 3 of the access points - all from within the same application if required. One example would be sourcing real-time streaming Pricing data from your RTDS server as well as say historical pricing events from the cloud-based Delivery platform.

## <a id="when_to_use_direct_call"></a>Finally, when should developers use RDP APIs direct call?
 
 If developers use the programming languages that currently not supported by RDP ease-of-use Libraries such as Java, C++, R, ..etc, they can use a basic HTTP request-response and JSON message features of those languages to get content from RDP APIs easily.

The other case is developers need to manual control all operations between the application and the platform such as HTTP status/connection handler, credentials and session management, etc (example:  server application, web application or GUI application). A manual HTTP request-response operations with Delivery Platform APIs are still simple and easy to implement.

## <a id="summary"></a>Summary

The [Delivery Platform (RDP) Libraries](https://developers.lseg.com/en/api-catalog/refinitiv-data-platform/refinitiv-data-platform-libraries) let developers rapid create the application to access LSEG Platform content with a few line of code that easy to understand and maintenance. Developers can focus on implement the business logic or analysis data without worry about the connection, authentication detail with the LSEG Platforms.

The Libraries also support a wide range of developers from casual coder, data scientists, professional trader to seasoned programmer via various layers and delivery modes. Any developers with any level of knowledge can pick the layer that suitable for them and start implement the application easily. 

In the meantime, RDP APIs let developers manual control the connection, authentication and session logic to retrieve LSEG content via a simple Cloud Delivery Web Based API. 

### The Data Library Advantage

1. Use a few line of code to manage and retrieve data.
2. Support all LSEG platforms: Desktop, Cloud-based and Deployed infrastructure.
3. Providers a set of helper types and enumerate variables to create query message quickly.
4. The Libraries manage the connection, credentials and session operations for developers. No need to manual control them in the application level.
5. The Libraries keeps expanding functionalities to support new Services by LSEG.

### RDP Libraries Disadvantages 
1. Support Python, .Net and TypeScript/JavaScript technologies only.
